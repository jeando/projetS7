Pseudocode

ForwardBackward(guessState, sequenceIndex):
    if sequenceIndex is past the end of the sequence, return 1
    if (guessState, sequenceIndex) has been seen before, return saved result
    result = 0
    for each neighboring state n:
        result = result + (transition probability from guessState to n given observation element at sequenceIndex)
                        * ForwardBackward(n, sequenceIndex+1)
    save result for (guessState, sequenceIndex)
    return result
